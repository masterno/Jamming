# Implementation Plan: Jamming Project

This document outlines the steps to build the Jamming web application, a tool that allows users to search for songs, create custom playlists, and save them to their Spotify account.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Initial Structure

1.  **Initialize Git Repository:**
    *   Create a new local Git repository.
    *   Create a corresponding repository on GitHub.
2.  **Set Up React Project:**
    *   Use Create React App or Vite to bootstrap the React application.
    *   Ensure basic project structure (e.g., `src`, `public`, `components`, `services`).
3.  **Basic UI Layout:**
    *   Create placeholder components for main sections: Search Bar, Search Results, Playlist.
    *   Set up basic CSS for layout.
4.  **Create Initial `README.md`:**
    *   Add a preliminary `README.md` with project title and a brief description.

## Phase 2: Spotify API Integration & Authentication

1.  **Spotify Developer Account Setup:**
    *   Register the application on the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
    *   Obtain Client ID and configure Redirect URIs.
2.  **Implement Spotify Authentication:**
    *   Choose an OAuth flow (Implicit Grant Flow is simpler for client-side only, Authorization Code Flow with PKCE is more secure if a backend component is considered later).
    *   Create a utility/service to handle the authentication process.
    *   Store the access token securely in the application state (e.g., React Context or state management library).
    *   Handle token expiration and refresh if applicable.
3.  **Create Spotify API Service Module:**
    *   Develop a module to encapsulate API calls to Spotify.
    *   Functions needed:
        *   `searchTracks(term)`
        *   `getUserProfile()` (to get user ID for playlist creation)
        *   `createPlaylist(userId, playlistName)`
        *   `addTracksToPlaylist(playlistId, trackUris)`

## Phase 3: Core UI Components Development

1.  **`SearchBar` Component:**
    *   Input field for users to enter search terms (song title, artist, etc.).
    *   Submit button to trigger the search.
2.  **`Track` Component:**
    *   Display individual song information: title, artist, album.
    *   Include an "Add" button (or similar) to add the track to the custom playlist.
    *   If the track is in the custom playlist, display a "Remove" button.
3.  **`TrackList` Component:**
    *   A reusable component to display a list of `Track` components.
    *   Used for both search results and the custom playlist.
4.  **`Playlist` Component:**
    *   Input field for the user to name their custom playlist.
    *   Display the list of tracks added to the playlist (using `TrackList`).
    *   "Save to Spotify" button.
5.  **`App` Component (Main Application Logic):**
    *   Manage overall application state:
        *   Search results.
        *   Custom playlist tracks.
        *   Playlist name.
        *   Spotify access token.
    *   Orchestrate interactions between components.

## Phase 4: Feature Implementation

1.  **Search Functionality:**
    *   Connect `SearchBar` input to the `searchTracks` API call.
    *   Update application state with search results.
    *   Render search results using `TrackList` and `Track` components.
2.  **Playlist Creation & Management:**
    *   Implement adding tracks from search results to the custom playlist state.
    *   Implement removing tracks from the custom playlist state.
    *   Allow users to update the playlist name.
3.  **Saving Playlist to Spotify:**
    *   When "Save to Spotify" is clicked:
        *   Get the current user's Spotify ID (if not already fetched).
        *   Call `createPlaylist` API with the playlist name.
        *   Call `addTracksToPlaylist` API with the URIs of the tracks in the custom playlist.
        *   Provide feedback to the user (success/error message).
        *   Optionally, clear the local playlist after successful save.

## Phase 5: Styling and User Experience (UX)

1.  **Apply CSS Styling:**
    *   Style all components for a visually appealing and intuitive interface.
    *   Consider using a CSS framework or methodology (e.g., Tailwind CSS, BEM, CSS Modules).
2.  **Responsiveness:**
    *   Ensure the application is usable on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
3.  **Error Handling & Loading States:**
    *   Implement visual feedback for API request loading states.
    *   Display user-friendly error messages for API failures or invalid user actions.

## Phase 6: Deployment

1.  **Choose a Deployment Platform:**
    *   Select a platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).
2.  **Build Configuration:**
    *   Configure build scripts and environment variables (especially Spotify Client ID and Redirect URI).
3.  **Deploy Application:**
    *   Push code to the main branch and set up automatic deployments if supported.
    *   Test the deployed application thoroughly.

## Phase 7: Documentation (README.md Finalization)

1.  **Update `README.md`:**
    *   **Purpose of the project:** Clearly state what the application does.
    *   **Technologies used:** List React, Spotify API, and any other significant libraries/tools.
    *   **Features:** Detail the implemented features.
    *   **Setup/Installation Instructions:** How to run the project locally.
    *   **Link to Deployed Application.**
    *   **Future work:** List potential enhancements or features not yet implemented.

## Technologies Stack (Summary)

*   **Frontend:** React.js
*   **API:** Spotify Web API
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
*   **Styling:** CSS (specific approach TBD)
*   **Deployment:** TBD (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)

## Future Work (Post-MVP Considerations)

*   More advanced search filters (genre, year, etc.).
*   Ability to edit existing Spotify playlists.
*   User accounts for saving multiple playlists within the app (if not solely relying on Spotify).
*   Drag-and-drop interface for playlist ordering.
*   Improved UI/UX animations and transitions.
